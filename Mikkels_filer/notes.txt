All files are working, last tested.

All functions should be usable locally.

Start up a new server with:
chat_cupervisor:start_link_from_shell().

Then call:
chat_client:createGroup(friends).

After that you can join or send essages with:
chat_client:joinGroup(friends, self()).
chat_client:sendMessage(friends, self(), "Hello There!").

Then all the other functions are accesable:
chat_client:findGroup(friends).
chat_client:fidnUser(friends, self()).
chat_client:listUsers(friends).
chat_client:viewHistory(friends).

The prints don't work yet, because i haven't had time to update them, but i will do that later.
