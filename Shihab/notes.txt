All files are working, last tested.

All functions should be usable locally.

Start up a new server with:
chat_supervisor:start_link_from_shell().
TODO:
1. Integrate JOIN GROUP functionalities
2. Do integration testing
Then call:
chat_client:createGroup(friends).

After that you can join or send essages with:
chat_client:joinGroup(friends, self()).
chat_client:sendMessage(friends, self(), "Hello There!").

Then all the other functions are accesable:
chat_client:findGroup(friends).
chat_client:findUser(friends, self()).
chat_client:listUsers(friends).
chat_client:viewHistory(friends).

The prints don't work yet, because i haven't had time to update them, but i will do that later.

addNode() doesnt work for me.
addNode() ->
    mnesia:start(),
    RunningNodes = mnesia:system_info(running_db_nodes),
    % Host is one of the random nodes already running Mnesia
    Host = lists:nth(rand:uniform(length(RunningNodes)), RunningNodes),
    rpc:call(Host, db_logic, addReplica, [node()]),
    chat_supervisor:start_link_from_shell().
